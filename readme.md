Blurhash is an algorithm that encodes an image into a short string. When you decode the string back into an image, you get a gradient of colors that represent the original image.

### Encoding
```rust
use blurhash::encode;
use image::GenericImageView;

fn main() {
  let img = image::open("image.png").unwrap();

  let (width, height) = img.dimensions();

  let blurhash =
      encode(
          4, 3,
          width, height,
          &img.to_rgba8(),
      );
}
```

### Decoding
```rust
use blurhash::decode;

let pixels =
    decode(
        "LBAdAqof00WCqZj[PDay0.WB}pof",
        50,
        50,
        1.0,
    );
```
